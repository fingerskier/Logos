TODO
====
	* Routes: add iron-router, get verses via dynamic URLs
	* Performance: Meteor is super-fast but 1) need to test with thousands of verses and 2) can clean-up a bunch of unnecessary libs
	* Style: the default bootstrap ain't gonna cut it for long...
	* Hosting: not yet permanently hosted; soon to be @ anamnesis.me :)
